## Planning

### wat it do?

- users add n songs to a playlist every week
- users vote on how much they like each added song
- most liked songs are added to a 'good songs' playlist
- scoring per song is based on average score not total
- can only vote if you added songs in previous week
- replace this spreadsheet https://goo.gl/Fv6fzz

### architecture

- frontend: react app with webpack and stuff. axios for requests
- backend: express app with cors enabled lol
- database: mongodb
